# ENet

This repository contains a tensorflow 2.0 implementation of Enet as in:

Paszke, A.; Chaurasia, A.; Kim, S.; Culurciello, E. ENet: **A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation.** [arXiv:1606.02147 [cs] 2016.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02147.pdf)

 Enet is a lightweight neural network conceveid with speed as efficiency in mind.

## Try it out

You can try it out directly in this [Colab notebook]().

## Pretrained weights

You can find them [here]() for the [CamVid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/) dataset. The weights for different datasets will be released as soon as possible.

## A few example

The code in this repository is distributed under the BSD v3 Licemse.<br/>
